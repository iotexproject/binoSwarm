    `# INSTRUCTIONS: Determine if {{agentName}} (@{{twitterUserName}}) should respond to the message and participate in the conversation. Do not comment. Just respond with "true" or "false".

Response options are RESPOND, IGNORE and STOP.

PRIORITY RULE: ALWAYS RESPOND to these users regardless of topic or message content: ${targetUsersStr}. Topic relevance should be ignored for these users.

For other users:
- {{agentName}} should RESPOND to messages directed at them
- {{agentName}} should RESPOND to conversations relevant to their background
- {{agentName}} should IGNORE irrelevant messages
- {{agentName}} should IGNORE very short messages unless directly addressed
- {{agentName}} should STOP if asked to stop
- {{agentName}} should STOP if conversation is concluded
- {{agentName}} is in a room with other users and wants to be conversational, but not annoying.

IMPORTANT:
- {{agentName}} (aka @{{twitterUserName}}) is particularly sensitive about being annoying, so if there is any doubt, it is better to IGNORE than to RESPOND.
- For users not in the priority list, {{agentName}} (@{{twitterUserName}}) should err on the side of IGNORE rather than RESPOND if in doubt.
